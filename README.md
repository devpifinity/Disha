## Development

### Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in `frontend/src/components/`
2. Add pages in `frontend/src/pages/`
3. Update routing in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
4. Use existing UI components from `frontend/src/components/ui/`

### Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration is in `tailwind.config.ts`.

- Use existing utility classes when possible
- Follow the design system established in the UI components
- Custom components should be added to `frontend/src/components/ui/`

## Building for Production

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Preview the build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

The production build will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

### Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting service

### Docker (Optional)

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in `vite.config.ts` or kill the process using port 8080

2. **Module not found errors**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Clear cache: `npm run clean && npm install`

3. **TypeScript errors**
   - Run `npm run typecheck` to see all type errors
   - Ensure all required types are installed
